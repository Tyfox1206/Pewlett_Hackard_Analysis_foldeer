# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis_foldeer
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to see the impact on Pewlett Hackard's workforce as the older generation beings to retire. To do this I took all the prior CSV files they used to track employees and inputted them into database. After inputting them into a database I ran queries on the database to find out specific information that could help show the impact the retiring members would have on the work force. 

## Results
First, I looked at the number of people retiring in a specific role. This showed:
- Most of the retirement ready individuals are in either senior staff or senior engineering.
- There are 25,916 senior engineers and 24,926 senior staff members in the retirement range.

Then I took at the employees that would be eligible to work with in a mentorship program
- There were a total of 1549 individuals that fell within the criteria to be in the mentorship program.
- There are multiple people within the senior staff and senior engineering roles that could be worth within the mentorship program to help new employees grow into the vacancies.

## Summary
There are a total of 72,458 employees in the range for retirement that work for Pewlett Hackard. To maintain a standard of operations and since all employees will not retire on the same day the best way to make an impact in this situation is offer the mentorship program to all qualified individuals and then increase recruitment in these specific areas that have a large number of employees retiring. There are enough retirement ready individuals in the range for the mentorship program to mentor the next generation in the departments that need the attention. I believe a query that breaks out the retirement ready group into further smaller group would be extremely helpful in determining when the work force change will be felt most. Specifically breaking the table down further into quarters of the fiscal year, it would allow targeted recruit to be more accurate and allow for adjustments in budgeting. A query that shows total number of employees in each department along with the number of those retiring to see what percentage of the department is retiring. also, this will show if there are enough employees to make up for some of the loss of the older generation
